Setting Up the Project

1. Open Visual Studio:
Start Visual Studio and open your project by selecting File > Open > Project/Solution and navigating to your project file (e.g., RecipeApp.sln).

2. Ensure Your Solution Explorer is Visible:
If the Solution Explorer is not visible, open it by selecting View > Solution Explorer or pressing Ctrl+Alt+L.

Compiling the Project

1. Build the Solution:
In the Solution Explorer, ensure your project is selected.
Go to Build > Build Solution or press Ctrl+Shift+B. This will compile your project, and Visual Studio will display any errors or warnings in the Output window.

Running the Application

1. Run the Application:
After building the solution successfully, you can run the application by pressing F5 or selecting Debug > Start Debugging from the menu.
Alternatively, you can select Debug > Start Without Debugging or press Ctrl+F5 if you don't want to run the debugger.

Using the Application

1. Interacting with the GUI:
Once the application is running, the main window of your WPF application will appear.
You can interact with the user interface to add recipes, display them, scale them, reset quantities, clear recipes, and check for calories exceeding the threshold.
